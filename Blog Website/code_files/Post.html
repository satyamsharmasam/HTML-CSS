                    <span>W</span>eb development is the act of building, creating and maintaining websites. The field
                    encompasses a broad
                    range of tasks including everything from coding, to technical design, to the performance of a
                    website or
                    application running on the internet. Web development consists of front-end and back-end components:

                <h3>What Are the 3 Types of Web Development?</h4>
                    <p>There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.

                        Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work itself
                        is often broken down into three types:
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Front-end development: </span>is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see
                        and interact
                        with: the user interface (UI). Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
                        often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the
                        site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device types</p>
                    <p><span>Back-end development: </span>is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do
                        not see. This
                        is also known as server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the
                        behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site. </p>
                    <p><span>Full-stack development: </span>is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible
                        for the site or app take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically
                        performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end developers.

                <h3>What Does a Web Developer Do?</h3>
                <p>Web developers develop websites, specifically by creating the site’s code, connecting it to a server
                    and
                    maintaining its accessibility to users.</p>
                <p>Web development is responsible for creating the sites and applications we use through a web browser
                    in
                    our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals
                    like
                    data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough
                    knowledge
                    of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the website’s database will
                    live,
                    known as a back-end. </p>
                <p>The back-end is dependent upon the website’s server, which stores web pages and applications to be
                    loaded
                    into the web browser upon request. The server acts as an intermediary between the web page or
                    application and the data stored within the server, facilitating communication between the database
                    and
                    the client.</p>
                <p>Web developers are also responsible for creating the front-end of a website through the use of HTML,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript, which creates the layout and style that the user sees and interacts with when using
                    the
                    site.</p>
                <p>Finally, web developers are responsible for maintaining the site's functionality and overall
                    performance
                    over time</p>

                <h3>Is Web Development a Good Career?</h3>
                <p>According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for a web developer is
                    $78,000, and positions are expected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average
                    for other occupations.</p>
                <p>The average salary of a web developer was $77,200, according to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor
                    Statistics. Additionally, web developer jobs are expected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030,
                    faster than the average for other occupations.</p>
                <p>Web developers are in high demand. There are currently more than 5,000 front-end developer jobs at
                    nearly 2,000 companies nationwide on Built In's job board.</p>
